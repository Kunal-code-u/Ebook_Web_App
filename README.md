 ● The Book Retail Management System aims to streamline and enhance the book retail
experience for both users and administrators.
● In response to the growing demand for online book purchasing, our system provides a
user-friendly platform for customers to explore, purchase, and manage their book collections.
● Simultaneously, administrators can efficiently oversee inventory and manage user accounts
(adding, removing books, monitoring order status).
